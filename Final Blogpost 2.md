Introduction:
============
When mapping collected data to a world map, using the Basemap package within matplotlib, there are several disadvantages. Having a fair understanding of Python is necessary, and the code must be changed each time a figure is produced. Depending on how many data points are being mapped, what projection is being used, and the detail of the map this process can take several minutes.

Our Program uses the Pillow, a friendly PIL (python Imaging Library) fork which allows us to image mapping data more efficiently and rapidly.

Further Developement: 
======================
- create a library
- create a user interface in python 
- adding grid and stylistic detail
